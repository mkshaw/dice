# dice

I want to play Risk with my family on this remote Christmas, for which I need three dice. I'm sure online dice exist, but why not code them up for fun?

To run the code, call `python3 main.py number` where "number" is the number of dice you need (1-3 in Risk, depending on your number of armies and whether you're attacking or defending).
